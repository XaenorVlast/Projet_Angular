                    activities. We are a large international family that gives a unique character to this beautiful

                </p>
                <p>To facilitate the involvement of our contributors and allow the project to grow in a more dynamic way,

                <p>✅ The aim is to match your skills and interests to the needs of the project.

                <p>We have tons of ideas and you probably have even more, but it is quite a challenge to prioritize
                    them, to build a roadmap, and to manage projects when every participant is a volunteer with often
                    limited time available.</p>

                    improve their design, to create impactful presentation materials etc.</p>

                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>We have a <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/development">lot of development work to do</a>. On
                    the Open Food Facts backend (Perl and MongoDB), API (JSON), web site (templatized HTML5, JS,
                    Foundation), our <a

                    but also to build new cool reuses etc. We have SDK projects in many programming languages to
                    ensure anyone can reuse.
