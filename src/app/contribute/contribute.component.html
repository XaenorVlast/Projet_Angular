        <h2 class="emphasized-title">Expert help needed</h2>
        <p>Developing Open Food Facts also requires specialized knowledge and expertise in many different areas:</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <ul class="text-center">
      <li>
        <h3>Project management</h3>
        <p>We have tons of ideas, and you probably have even more, but it is quite a challenge to prioritize them, to
          build a roadmap, and to manage projects when every participant is a volunteer with often limited time
          available.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>We need help to build a better user experience on the Open Food Facts website and mobile app, to improve their
          design, to create impactful presentation materials, etc.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>We have a <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/development">lot of development work to do</a>. On the
          Open Food Facts backend (Perl and MongoDB), API (JSON), website (templatized HTML5, JS, Foundation), our <a
            href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app">Flutter mobile app for iOS and Android</a>, but also to
          build new cool reuses, etc. We have SDK projects in many programming languages to ensure anyone can
          reuse.</p>
